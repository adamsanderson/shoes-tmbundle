== A tiny TextMate bundle for the tiny toolkit

Shoes, the tiny toolkit, is a great way to create GUI apps that can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Learn more about Shoes at http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes.

This is just a tiny TextMate bundle. Shoes speaks Ruby, so using this bundle requires that you have the Ruby bundle installed and activated.

= Installation

If you just want to use the bundle with TextMate, you can download shoes.tmbundle directly. Just double-click to install (requires TextMate...in case that wasn't already obvious).
